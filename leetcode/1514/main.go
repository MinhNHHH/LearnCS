// You are given an undirected weighted graph of n nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where edges[i] = [a, b] is an undirected edge connecting the nodes a and b with a probability of success of traversing that edge succProb[i].

// Given two nodes start and end, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from start to end and return its success probability.

// If there is no path from start to end, return 0. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5

// Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
// Output: 0.25000
// Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
