// Strings value are immutable
// Strings can be compared with comparision operators like == and <
// The comparision is done byte by byte.
// Immutability means that it is safe for two copies of a string to share the same underlying memory,

// A string is a sequence of bytes, and each character within the string may consist of multiple bytes
// A rune, on the other hand, represents a single Unicode character regardless of its byte representation.
